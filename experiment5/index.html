          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>A program that tries to create a smudged impression based off of some initial images. The first two images are selected due to my love for the video game series of pokemon, while the last image selected was due to how I feel that the colors work best for this project</p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>How this works is that the impression is that it takes one of the initial images and generates uniform circles across of the images. The circles are generated with a double for loop, uniformly spread throughout the image. Initial colors are selected based off of the initial image pixel at the center of each circle. Each circle will then randomly mutate, which will shift their position accordin gto a random gaussian curve, changing their color if their new center is at a new color. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>There is a lot of confusion on how to build the project since there was little to go off of in the initial examples. But after seeing the new examples, that helped a lot with the project. I did not have any time to work on it sadly, so I wish I could've spent more time to improve this generator. But I am 80% with what I ended up with.</p>
