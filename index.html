          <p>
            Hi, my name is Vincent and I am a 4th year CS:GD student from San
            Francisco. I enjoy playing many different video games from time to
            time, with one of my latest obsessions being Limbus Company. I have
            been programming for over 6 years, knowing C/C++, Python, and
            Javascript, and I am excited to practice using generative methods
            during my time in this course
          </p>
