          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            In this experiment, I wanted to create a rippling world, one that
            will fluctuate over time and shift in color as the user moves around
            the scene.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            The main rippling effect of the scene is controlled by a noise
            function. This function will essentially get the noise of a tile in
            space, and will essentially determine the height of a tile. The
            higher the tile is, this higher its G value is, causing it to be
            brighter in color as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the scrolling effect, due to the camera being decoupled from the
            main function, instead of tracking camera position, simple holding
            down any arrow key will adjust the color of the drawn tiles, where
            the horizontal axis will control the red coloring, and the vertical
            axis controlling the blus coloring. Additionally, instead of looping
            from 0 to 255, in a cycle, when the value goes below 0, it will turn
            that decrease into an increase. The same applies when going over 255
            as well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Although I initially tried to implemente a different way of "rippling" the world, I feel very satisfied with what I managed to create. The only problem is that somehow the hash file doesn't work at all for this site and I have no idea how to fix it.
